# Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that is a substitution cipher.  **The Caesar Cipher is NOT secure**

# Explanation
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions up or down the alphabet. The fixed number is known and the key. 

If the key happened the be three, it would look something like this:
- A -> D
- B -> E
- C -> F
- D -> G
- E -> H
